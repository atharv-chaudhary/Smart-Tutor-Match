# Smart Tutor Match – Student Project



## Overview

Smart Tutor Match is a front-end prototype of a tutor-matching platform. The goal of this project is to help students find tutors based on their 

academic requirements such as subject, class level, and preferred mode of learning.



## Problem Faced

Many students struggle to find tutors who match their exact needs. This problem is more common in smaller towns where access to quality 

academic support is limited. This project explores how a simple web-based system can help solve this issue.



## How the Website Works

1. The student enters subject, class, and learning mode on the homepage.

2. On submitting the form, the data is passed to a results page.

3. The results page displays sample tutor profiles that match the student's requirements.

4. Tutor profiles are displayed in a grid-based card layout for better readability and user experience.



## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to structure the web pages.

- CSS: Used for layout, design, and card-based sections.

- JavaScript: Used to transfer user input and dynamically display tutor information.



## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to structure web pages using HTML, style them using CSS, and add basic logic using JavaScript. I also

learned how to break a real-world problem into smaller technical components.



## Future Improvements

- Add a backend using Python (Flask or Django).

- Store tutor data in a database.

- Implement intelligent tutor matching logic.

- Add user authentication and feedback systems.



## Disclaimer

This project is a prototype built for learning purposes. Tutor profiles shown are sample data.
